## Transport Options

There are many ways to get to Zetland. I recommend using any of the methods below:

### Taxi

A cab ride from the airport to my house can cost up to $40 depending on traffic.

### Train

You can take the Sydney Airport Train ($17.80 AUD) to get to the house. If it’s more than person traveling, then it makes more sense to take a taxi. You need to get off on Green Square Station and from there you need to walk to the house. The walk takes about 17 minutes and has been plotted in the following map:
