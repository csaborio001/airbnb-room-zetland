# Buzzing In

I will have to meet you to give you access to the apartment, therefore it is necessary that you let me know an estimated time of your arrival.

Once you get to the building, follow the instructions to call apartment 47 and Iâ€™ll buzz you in. You need to come up to the 9th floor.

?> To buzz in, use the intercom an enter **4722**

## Walkthrough of getting to the apartment:

(please note that the apartment entrance looks difference than the video, but procedure is the same)

!> Please note that building has been renovated since the video was made!

## The Swipe Card

You will receive a key and a FOB (swipe) to access the building and lifts. The FOB is your responsibility and if you lose it then the replacement cost ($100) will be deducted from your security deposit.
