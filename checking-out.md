# Checking Out

Checkout is at **10:00 am**, please have the key ready by then.

!> If I am not around, please leave the key on the kitchen counter.

If you need a late checkout, please let me know **in advance** and depending on availability we can work something out.

If late checkout is not available and your flight leaves late, you can leave your suitcases in the lounge area.
