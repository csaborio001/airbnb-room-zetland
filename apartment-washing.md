# Washer / Dryer

If you need to wash your clothes, please let me know and Iâ€™ll explain how to work the washer. The cost of using the washer is $5 and I provide the detergent.

You can then hang the clothes in the balcony to dry or use the dryer for an additional fee.

?> If you are staying here for more than a week, you can use the washer for free, I only as that you use your own detergent.
